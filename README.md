Work that I've done

- "Beam Thickness.py" is an interative program that attempts to find the ideal thickness for a supportive beam based upon a number of pre-established criteria.
- "Diffusion.py" is a model for the extent of heterogeneous diffusion in a steel.
- "Model for Crystal Nucleation.py" is a simulation for the nucleation and growth of crystals.
- "Carbon Diffusion.py" is a simulation for the diffusion of a single carbon atom between intersitial sites in steel.
- "Undercooling.py" is a iterative model for the relationship between undercooling temperature and the critical radius for crystal nucleation.
